# Scriptings-for-Digital-Forms

Scriptings were done using Microsoft Excel, in a format thet can be read by Open Data Kit (ODK).
It was then converted to XML format which displays the form as it would be displayed.

Two forms were created for:
* Laboratory Baseline and
* Medical history questionnaire

This repository contains the xlsx and XML formats of both forms.
